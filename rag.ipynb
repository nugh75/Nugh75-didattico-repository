This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computa- tional overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts\\u2014a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expand- ing their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM\\u2019s inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method\\u2019s efficacy and its nuances in application.\",\n",

The \\u201cTree of Thoughts\\u201d (Yao et al. 2023; Long 2023) emerges as a notable solution. While one LLM is dedicated to idea generation, another steps in to as- sess the merit of these ideas, following a halting-assessment- resuming cycle. This iterative process, anchored by tree search, has shown marked effectiveness, especially in tasks with a breadth of continuations. We see this progression as akin to humans employing tools to circumvent working memory limitations, serving as an external augmentation for LLMs (Mialon et al. 2023).\",\n",

      "  \"Recent developments in large language models (Chowdhery et al. 2022; Thoppilan et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2023, inter alia) have spotlighted their efficacy in general problem solving (Huang and Chang 2022; Suzgun et al. 2022), code gen- eration (Chen et al. 2021; Austin et al. 2021), and instruc- tion following (Ouyang et al. 2022; Bai et al. 2022). While early models relied on direct answer strategies (Brown et al. 2020), contemporary research veers towards linear reason- ing paths (Wei et al. 2022b; Kojima et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022) by breaking problems into sub-tasks for solution dis- covery, or harnesses external mechanisms to alter token gen- eration by changing the context (Zhou et al. 2022; Drozdov et al. 2022; Yao et al. 2023).\",\n",

Each query to online LLM APIs such as GPT-4\\u2014a focal point of our study\\u2014incurs a monetary expense (Chen, Za- haria, and Zou 2023) but also contributes to latency, a sig- nificant limitation especially critical in real-time applica- tions. Cumulative delays from these queries can compro- mise solution efficiency. Infrastructure-wise, continuous in- teractions can stress systems, leading to potential bandwidth constraints and reduced model availability (Aminabadi et al. 2022). Moreover, the environmental implications cannot be ignored; incessant querying escalates the energy consump- tion of already power-hungry data centers, exacerbating the carbon footprint (Wu et al. 2022; Dhar 2020).\",\n",

      "  \"Drawing upon both the intricate nuances of human rea- soning and the disciplined precision of algorithmic method- ologies, our work aims to fuse these dual facets to aug- ment reasoning capabilities within LLMs. Existing research underscores that humans, when navigating complex prob- lems, instinctively draw upon past efforts, ensuring a com- prehensive contemplation rather than a narrow focus (Mon- sell 2003; Holyoak and Morrison 2005; Baddeley 2003). LLMs, with their generative span bounded only by token limits, appear poised to break through the barriers of human working memory. Spurred by this observation, we investi- gated if LLMs could mirror a similar layered exploration of ideas, referencing prior intermediate steps to sieve out infeasible options, all within their iterative generation cy- cle. And while humans excel with their intuitive acumen, al- gorithms stand out with organized, systematic exploration. Current techniques, like CoT, often sidestep this synergistic potential, imposing undue pressure on LLMs for on-the-spot precision. By capitalizing on LLMs\\u2019 recursive capabilities, we emulate a hybrid human-algorithmic approach. This is achieved through our use of algorithmic examples that cap- ture the essence of exploration, from initial candidates to validated solutions. Thus emerges our concept of the Algo- rithm of Thoughts (AoT), as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.\",\n",
      "  \"More broadly, our approach signifies a new paradigm of in-context learning. Instead of the traditional \\u201csupervised- learning\\u201d mold of [PROBLEM, SOLUTION] or [PROBLEM, SUCCESSIVE STEPS TO SOLUTION], we present a new structure that covers [PROBLEM, SEARCH PROCESS, SO- LUTION]. Naturally, when instructing an LLM using an al- gorithm, the anticipation leans towards the LLM simply imitating the algorithm\\u2019s iterative thinking. However, what emerges as intriguing is the LLM\\u2019s ability to infuse its own \\u201cintuition\\u201d to achieve a search efficiency that even surpasses the algorithm itself (see Fig. 5).\",\n",

      "  \"Chain-of-Thought. In CoT, LLMs are presented with ex- amples where a given question x unfolds through a chain of intermediate reasoning pieces c1, . . . , cn to reach an an- swer y, represented as x \\u2192 c1 \\u2192 . . . \\u2192 cn \\u2192 y (Wei et al. 2022b; Lyu et al. 2023). By mimicking the examples in the context, the LLM automatically divides the solution into simpler linear steps to arrive at the answer, improv- ing performance across numerous reasoning benchmarks. Self-consistency (Wang et al. 2022) is a widely used de- coding strategy aimed at generating a variety of reason- ing paths by choosing the final answer through a majority vote, though this necessitates additional generations. Con- trary to CoT\\u2019s linear, direct progression, our approach pivots towards the explorative aspect of LLMs. We reconceptual- ize the c1, . . . , cn sequence, not merely as successive steps towards a solution, but as a dynamic, potentially mutable path that resembles an algorithmic search, allowing for ex- ploration, recalibration, and non-linear progression.\",\n",
      "  \"Least-to-Most prompting (L2M). Taking cues from ed- ucational psychology (Libby et al. 2008), L2M prompting directs the LLM to decompose the central problem into smaller subproblems. Each subproblem is tackled in se- quence, with the outcome appended before progressing to the next (Zhou et al. 2022; Drozdov et al. 2022). While this structured delineation is beneficial for broader generaliza- tion, it operates on the premise of finding a nearly perfect de- composition in a single attempt\\u2014ideal for problems with a clear-cut structure. Yet, when tasks intertwine with their de- composition complexities (like games of 24), this method\\u2019s inflexibility becomes apparent. Contrastingly, AoT not only underscores the active subproblem (as shown in Fig. 1), but also permits a more contemplative approach by entertaining various options for each subproblem, while maintaining ef- ficacy even with minimal prompts.\",\n",

We tackle this limitation by gen- erating the whole thought process within a single context.\",\n",

      "  \"Our strategy pivots on recognizing a core shortcoming of current in-context learning paradigms. CoT, while enhanc- ing the coherency of thought linkages leading to solutions, occasionally falters, presenting incorrect intermediate steps (Zelikman et al. 2022; Turpin et al. 2023; Lanham et al. 2023). Faithful CoT (Lyu et al. 2023) ought to amend this by eliciting symbolic chains of reasoning where the LLM\\u2019s output resembles task-specific pseudo-code, primed for de- terministic execution like Python. The intention is only to use the thought processes but not the outputs and inputs of each link since they have a tendency to be unreliable. But, the occasional missteps of CoT may not necessarily due to the LLM\\u2019s inability to compute correctly. The LLM, when confronted with questions that closely match conditions of previous in-context examples, may favor echoing those out- puts over generating the appropriate questions. To shed light on this phenomenon, we designed an experiment. Querying text-davinci-003 for arithmetic tasks (e.g., \\u201811 \\u2212 2 =\\u2019), we prefixed them with multiple in-context equations converging to an identical output (e.g. \\u201815 \\u2212 5 = 10, 8 + 2 = 10\\u2019). Our results, presented in Fig. 3, reveal a steep decline in accu- racy, suggesting that the mere presence of correct reasoning in the context might inadvertently compromise even basic arithmetic skills.\",\n",

      "  \"1. Decomposition into Subproblems. Given a problem, constructing a search tree that delineates feasible reasoning pathways is already a demanding task, excluding the actual problem-solving aspect. Any decomposition must consider not just the interrelations between subtasks, but also the ease of addressing each individually. Consider a simple multi- digit addition: while converting numbers to binary might be efficient for a computer, humans typically find base 10 arithmetic more intuitive. Furthermore, even if the subprob- lems remain constant, their execution might vary. Intuition can lead to shortcuts between solution steps, while its ab- sence might necessitate more detailed steps. Crafting the right prompt (i.e., in-context algorithmic examples) hinges on these nuances, determining the minimal tokens an LLM would need for dependable performance. This is not only essential to fit within the LLM\\u2019s context constraints but also vital for efficacy, as we\\u2019d expect LLMs to address problems resonant with its context using a similar token volume.\",\n",
      "  \"2. Proposing Solutions to Subproblems. A dominant ap- proach in existing works involves direct sampling from LLM token output probabilities (Wang et al. 2022; Yao\",\n",
      "  \"The first five prime numbers:Text Completion2 = 87.6%1 = 12.3%......2, 3, 5, 7, 11probabilities for the first token\",\n",
      "  \"Figure 4: An example highlighting the drawback of isolated sampling of sequenced ideas. Input is denoted in blue, with the text-davinci-003 providing the green completions.\",\n",
      "  \"et al. 2023). Though effective for one-off answers (Kadavath et al. 2022) (with certain constraints (Robinson and Wingate 2022)), this method falls short in scenarios demanding a se- quence of samples to be integrated or evaluated within sub- sequent prompts (Robinson and Wingate 2022). To mini- mize model queries, we adopt an uninterrupted solution cre- ation process. Here, we directly and continuously generate solutions for the prevailing subproblem without any genera- tion pauses.\",\n",
      "  \"The benefits are three-fold. First, with all generated solu- tions existing within a shared context, there\\u2019s no need for in- dividual model queries for each solution evaluation. Second, while it may seem counterintuitive initially, isolated token or token group probabilities might not always yield meaning- ful choices. A simple illustration is found in Fig. 4. When evaluated independently, the second-most probable token for our inaugural number is \\u20181\\u2019\\u2014not qualifying as prime. But, when generation remains unbroken, the derived sequence is correct. This incongruence points towards the restrictive na- ture of the Markov property in sequence modeling. Core to our perspective is the premise that for sequential tasks like algorithmic search, LLMs are more adept at generating en- tire sequences than intermittently pausing and re-initiating the token sampling process.\",\n",
      "  \"3. Gauging the Promise of a Subproblem. As above, existing techniques lean on additional prompting to dis- cern the potential of tree nodes, aiding decisions regard- ing exploration direction. Our observations suggest that if the most promising routes are encapsulated within the in- context examples, LLMs inherently gravitate towards prior- itizing those promising candidates. This diminishes the need for intricate prompt engineering and allows the incorpora- tion of intricate heuristics, whether intuitive or knowledge- driven. Again, the absence of disjoint prompts in our ap- proach allows for an immediate assessment of candidate vi- ability in the same generation.\",\n",
      "  \"4. Backtracking to a Preferable Juncture. The decision of which node to explore next (including retracing to a prior node) inherently depends on the selected tree-search algo- rithm. While previous studies (Yao et al. 2023) have em- ployed external means such as coded mechanisms for the search process, this restricts its broader appeal and entails additional customization. Our designs predominantly adopt a DFS approach supplemented by pruning. The aim is to\",\n",
      "  \"maintain proximity between nodes sharing the same par- ent, thereby encouraging the LLM to prioritize local over distant features. Additionally, we present performance met- rics for the AoT approach grounded in BFS. Our reliance on the model\\u2019s inherent capacity to glean insights from in- context examples obviates the necessity for additional, be- spoke mechanisms.\",\n",
      "  \"Experiments We show that AoT surpasses the performance of other single-prompt methods (e.g. standard, CoT/-SC prompting) while remaining competitive even when compared to meth- ods that utilize external mechanisms, such as ToT, in bench- marks like the game of 24 and 5x5 mini crosswords.\",\n",
      "  \"Game of 24 The game of 24 is a mathematical card game in which play- ers are given four numbers and must use addition, subtrac- tion, multiplication, and division (each operation can be used more than once) to manipulate those numbers to total 24. For instance, for the numbers \\u20188 8 5 4\\u2019, one solution would be \\u20188 \\u2217 (5 \\u2212 (8/4)) = 24\\u2019. At first glance, the game might appear straightforward. However, a cursory calculation sug- gests there are nearly 13,000 distinct expressions possible for any set of four numbers (without accounting for the com- mutative properties of addition and multiplication), making it a formidable challenge for present-day LLMs.\",\n",
      "  \"Task Setup. Adhering to the setup detailed in (Yao et al. 2023), we use games from indices 901-1000, sourced from the 1362 games ranked by relative difficulty at 4nums.com. For an attempt to be considered successful, it must derive a total of 24 using the exact numbers provided and only the allowed operations.\",\n",
      "  \"Baselines. Standard prompting and CoT are used in the 5- shot setting, with CoT integrating 3 steps for the operations. These methods are sampled 100 times, and the averaged suc- cess rates from these samples are reported. CoT-SC is also tested with 100 votes in our setup. For ToT, we use a breadth of 5. The performance metrics from their study are directly cited to obviate the need for needless carbon emissions.\",\n",
      "  \"AoT Setup. We employ the same 5-shot setting as in stan- dard prompting and CoT baseline setup. Our in-context sam- ples leverage a DFS-style search algorithm, which, for clar- ity, is the same version used when contrasting with tra- ditional DFS in Fig. 5. During each subtree exploration, dubbed either the \\u2018first step\\u2019 or \\u2018first operation\\u2019, we choose two numbers\\u2014illustrated by the selection of 8 and 6 in the third \\u2019first step\\u2019 (i.e., subtree labeled \\u20183\\u2019) of Fig. 1\\u2014and a corresponding operation (e.g., 8 \\u2212 6). This operation results in a new number, 2, leaving us with three numbers in total. A thorough combing of these three numbers culminates in 19 leaf nodes, all visible under the \\u20183\\u2019 subtree in Fig. 1. We aim to assess two aspects: the ability of the LLM to pin- point promising first operations, which directly impacts the number of resolved leaf nodes, and its performance against a conventional DFS. Details on the prompts we employed are provided in the Appendix. As our method emphasizes\",\n",
      "  \"sequential generation over trajectory sampling, we operate with a temperature setting of 0.\",\n",
      "  \"Results. From Table 1, it\\u2019s evident that standard prompt- ing combined with CoT/-SC significantly lags behind tree search methods when used with LLMs. The \\u201cStandard + Re- fine\\u201d result, showing a 27% success rate, is referenced from (Yao et al. 2023). This method involves iteratively asking the LLM (up to 10 iterations) to refine its answer if the initial one is incorrect. Meanwhile, ToT is limited to a maximum of 100 node visits, translating to several hundred LLM queries for each example. Remarkably, AoT achieves its results with just a single query. Despite reducing the number of requests by more than a factor of 100, AoT still outperforms ToT in this task.\",\n",

      "  \"Error Analysis. Using a strictly LLM-centric approach\\u2014 eschewing any external tooling or edits\\u2014we sought to cat- egorize mistakes observed during the game of 24. This aids in highlighting areas for refinement when solely deploying LLMs. We\\u2019ve classified these errors into four distinct, ex- haustive categories: 1) Out-of-token error: The LLM reaches its maximum token threshold without identifying a solution. 2) Expression misstep: The LLM has the correct logic or steps but fails when trying to express or formulate them into a coherent answer. 3) Non-finalization error: The LLM dis- covers the solution but continues its search without consol- idating the finding. 4) Other errors: This umbrella term en- compasses other mistakes like computational errors that re- sult in overlooking the solution or furnishing incorrect an- swers. To exclusively showcase the AoT\\u2019s search capabil- ities, we also present the AoT + Manual Resolution ver- sion. Here, once the LLM pinpoints a solution, its final ar- ticulation is manually processed\\u2014a strategy also employed by the ToT method. As evidenced in Table 2, a notable 7% of mistakes stem from non-algorithmic factors like non- finalization and expression missteps. In fact, with manual resolution, AoT attains a 78% success rate, surpassing ToT. This underlines the potential for refining our prompt, espe- cially in areas concerning recognizing and expressing suc- cessful problem resolutions. Additionally, the token limi- tation underscores the appeal of expanding the generative context window, which may further bolster LLMs\\u2019 recursive reasoning when engaged with algorithmic examples.\",\n",

Words intersect at certain letters, offering additional hints to complete the puzzle.\",\n",
      "  \"Task Setup. Adhering to the setup outlined in (Yao et al. 2023), we draw our prompts from games 136, 141, 146, 151, and 156 out of the 156 games available on goobix.com. Our testing focuses on a set of 20 games, specifically games 1, 6, . . ., 91, and 96.\",\n",
      "  \"Baselines. Mirroring our approach for the game of 24, we benchmark our method against established techniques: stan- dard prompting, CoT, and ToT. For standard prompting, we provide both the crosswords and their respective solutions as in-context examples. CoT augments this by prompting the retrieval of words for each of the ten clues\\u2014equally split between horizontal and vertical orientations. We directly ex- tract the success rates of ToT from their original publication for comparison.\",\n",
      "  \"AoT Setup. We divide the process into two steps, each in- volving a query. Initially, we task the LLM with suggesting five potential words for each row and column. We then pin- point the starting word candidates that have the highest com- patibility with other words within the crossword framework. This preliminary phase mirrors a \\u2019warm-up\\u2019 sequence in al- gorithm initialization. In the subsequent step, we exclusively leverage the LLM\\u2019s algorithmic reasoning prowess, starting with the pre-selected word. The method involves cyclically choosing a likely option (specifically, a row or column) for insertion, generating candidate words, and assessing their compatibility with the words already on the board. If no match is found, the process shifts focus to another promising candidate. Otherwise, the word is added to the crossword, and the search continues. The cycle concludes either when the board is fully populated or no more suitable words can be found, which may be due to either incorrect existing words or the absence of matching words. Notably, this entire pro- cess unfolds within a single generation window. The algo- rithmic examples in our prompt (detailed in the Appendix)\",\n",

However, it trails behind ToT. An important observa- tion is the sheer volume of queries ToT employs, exceeding AoT\\u2019s by over a factor of 100. One factor hindering AoT from surpassing ToT is that the backtracking capability in- herent in the algorithmic example isn\\u2019t fully activated.

      "  \"Error Analysis. To understand the prevalent mistakes made by AoT, we\\u2019ve categorized the errors into four dis- tinct categories. In our analysis for each game, we focus on the initial error the LLM produces while charting its rea- soning path, given that an early error typically cascades into subsequent failures. 1) No preselections: LLM fails to gen- erate compatible words essential for the warm-start phase. Given a correctly preselected word, the second phase for re- cursive reasoning can exhibit errors including: 2) Expres- sion misstep: The LLM mistakenly believes it has exhausted all choices and jumps to an answer prematurely. 3) Incor- rect pattern extraction: The LLM wrongly extracts a pattern based on the current board layout. 4) Erroneous word place- ment: Despite recognizing the correct pattern, the LLM se- lects a mismatched word or misses better-fitting alternatives. Navigating the crossword complexity arises from outdated terms, esoteric references, and typographical mishaps. Pre- dominantly, the errors observed are due to misguided word placements followed by pattern misinterpretations. Also, the LLM seems challenged in aligning letters at precise indices to create word structures\\u2014 an obstracle circumvented by an external mechanism in the ToT framework.\",\n",

      "  \"Creative Writing\",\n",
      "  \"We use the creative writing task, also used by (Yao et al. 2023), where the LLM is provided with four arbitrary sentences. The objective is to craft a cohesive narrative divided into four paragraphs, with each paragraph culminating in one of the given sentences. This exercise not only fosters creativity but also emphasizes strategic deliberation.\",\n",
      "  \"Task Setup\",\n",
      "  \"Sentences are randomly sourced from randomwordgenerator.com, resulting in 100 distinct sets of inputs. Given the absence of predetermined correct answers, the primary focus lies in evaluating the coherence of the responses. We have noted that GPT-4 consistently aligns with these input guidelines. Evaluation is centered around assessing passage coherence using a GPT-4 zero- shot prompt, where each output is rated on a scale of 1 to 10. Each task response undergoes five such evaluations, with their scores being averaged subsequently.\",\n",
      "  \"Baselines\",\n",
      "  \"For this task, both standard and CoT prompts are employed without preliminary training. While the standard prompt directly guides the LLM to fashion a cohesive narrative based on stipulated parameters, the CoT prompt obliges the model to initially outline a succinct plan prior to drafting the narrative, serving as an intermediate cognitive bridge. For each task iteration, ten samples are generated using both the standard and CoT methods. Results of the ToT approach are presented without modification.\",\n",
      "  \"AoT Setup Mirroring ToT\\u2019s methodology, the task is tackled in a zero-shot setting. Our prompt instructs the model to first formulate five distinct plans. Subsequent to this, the model selects the most promising among them to shape a narrative and then refines it for optimal coherence. The exact prompts used for this zero-shot approach will be provided in the subsequent section.\",\n",
      "  \"Results As depicted in Fig. 8, AoT outpaces other singular query prompting techniques such as standard prompting and CoT in terms of performance. It also exhibits a marked improvement over ToT, although the difference is not statistically significant. Com- prehensive scores, along with the average query count needed for each method, are consolidated in Table 6. Notably, AoT necessitates fewer queries compared to ToT.\",\n",

      "  \"CoT vs. Single Iteration AoT in the Game of 24 To demonstrate that the tree search mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the CoT prompting, even in scenarios where AoT\\u2019s in-context examples include only a single initial operation in the game of 24, we draw a comparison between AoT (Short) and CoT. In this setup, AoT (Short) determines the first operation and subsequently conducts a tree search on the remaining three numbers. Interestingly, AoT (Short) achieves a success rate of 48%, while CoT lags significantly, securing only 4%. These results underscore the notion that even a rudimentary search mechanism can lead to significant performance enhancements.\",\n",
      "  \"Detailed Analysis on the Effect of the Length of the Prompts In this section, we delve deeper into Fig. 6 by presenting histograms for the successful, unsuccessful, and total games of \\u201824\\u2019, considering the number of initial steps in methods AoT (Short), AoT, and AoT (Long). These are displayed in Figs. 9-11.\",\n",
      "  \"From these figures, it becomes evident that the length of the prompts, measured by the number of initial steps included in in-context examples, correlates with the length of their solutions to test examples. This trend is consistent across all three cases, suggesting that AoT\\u2019s strategy in determining the number of initial steps is influenced by its in-context examples.\",\n",
      "  \"Interestingly, when AoT is provided a well-balanced set of initial steps that emphasize the most promising operations, it excels in solving the majority of games in earlier iterations. This indicates AoT\\u2019s capacity to prioritize swift problem-solving without sacrificing performance. This tendency is also observed in AoT (Long), albeit with a somewhat reduced success rate, as illustrated in Fig. 9.\",\n",

      "sentences. This exercise not only fosters creativity but also emphasizes strategic deliberation.\n",
      "Task Setup\n",
      "Sentences are randomly sourced from randomwordgenerator.com , resulting in 100 distinct sets of inputs. Given the absence of\n",
      "predetermined correct answers, the primary focus lies in evaluating the coherence of the responses. We have noted that GPT-4\n",
      "consistently aligns with these input guidelines. Evaluation is centered around assessing passage coherence using a GPT-4 zero-\n",
      "shot prompt, where each output is rated on a scale of 1 to 10. Each task response undergoes five such evaluations, with their\n",
      "scores being averaged subsequently.\n",
      "Baselines\n",
      "For this task, both standard and CoT prompts are employed without preliminary training. While the standard prompt directly\n",
      "guides the LLM to fashion a cohesive narrative based on stipulated parameters, the CoT prompt obliges the model to initially\n",
      "outline a succinct plan prior to drafting the narrative, serving as an intermediate cognitive bridge. For each task iteration,\n",
      "ten samples are generated using both the standard and CoT methods. Results of the ToT approach are presented without\n",
      "modification.\n",
      "AoT Setup\n",
      "Mirroring ToT’s methodology, the task is tackled in a zero-shot setting. Our prompt instructs the model to first formulate five\n",
      "distinct plans. Subsequent to this, the model selects the most promising among them to shape a narrative and then refines it for\n",
      "optimal coherence. The exact prompts used for this zero-shot approach will be provided in the subsequent section.\n",
      "Results\n",
      "As depicted in Fig. 8, AoT outpaces other singular query prompting techniques such as standard prompting and CoT in terms\n",
      "of performance. It also exhibits a marked improvement over ToT, although the difference is not statistically significant. Com-\n",

      "(Short) and CoT. In this setup, AoT (Short) determines the first operation and subsequently conducts a tree search on the\n",

      "Detailed Analysis on the Effect of the Length of the Prompts\n",
      "In this section, we delve deeper into Fig. 6 by presenting histograms for the successful, unsuccessful, and total games of ‘24’,\n",
      "considering the number of initial steps in methods AoT (Short), AoT, and AoT (Long). These are displayed in Figs. 9-11.\n",
      "From these figures, it becomes evident that the length of the prompts, measured by the number of initial steps included in\n",
      "in-context examples, correlates with the length of their solutions to test examples. This trend is consistent across all three cases,\n",
      "suggesting that AoT’s strategy in determining the number of initial steps is influenced by its in-context examples.\n",
      "Interestingly, when AoT is provided a well-balanced set of initial steps that emphasize the most promising operations, it\n",
      "excels in solving the majority of games in earlier iterations. This indicates AoT’s capacity to prioritize swift problem-solving\n",
